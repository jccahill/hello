        <h1>Joey Cahill</h1>
        <p> I took several art and design classes in highschool. Once I started taking these classes it kind of opened my eyes to the fact that I could make a passion of mine into a pratical career.
        I started my college education at UofL in the Hite Art Institute, but quickly ran out of money to afford that level of education... who would've thought.
        After taking a year off, working full time as a plumber/general contractor, I was able to get back on track at JCTC. I love the Communication Arts and Technology Program at JCTC!
        The classes are more my speed and every member of the staff are always willing to give a hand whenever it is needed.</p>
        <p> I'd like to leave the program with a strong portfolio that will land me a internship or a permanent position at an ad agency. I have bigger dreams to be my own boss one day, but who doesn't. We shall see.
        For now I'm happy with my progress and I look forward to learning new and useful skills.</p>
